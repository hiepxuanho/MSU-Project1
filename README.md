# Football Player Insights 2021 (FIFA 21)

## Overview
Collaborating with other teammates in a group of 4 to analyze the FIFA 21 player dataset to uncover insights into player performance, value, contracts, and other key metrics. By cleaning, transforming, and exploring the data, the goal is to identify trends that can inform decisions around player valuations, wage distributions, and overall performance comparisons.
## Objective
This project leverages the FIFA 21 dataset, which contains detailed information on over 18,000 football players, including their physical attributes, performance ratings, wages, and contract details. The analysis focuses on:

   - Cleaning and transforming key columns (e.g., monetary values, dates).
   - Exploring player value and wage distributions.
   - Understanding trends in player contracts and club associations.
   - Conducting Physical vs. performance analysis to find their relation.

## Repository Files
